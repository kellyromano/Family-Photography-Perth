 Kelly Romano specialises in newborn baby photography and in Family photography. Kelly capture gorgeous photos of your newborn baby around PerthKelly Romano love to try and come up with something unique for each family photo shoot.  If everyone is enjoying themselves during the photography session, then I can capture personalities, real smiles and genuine moments.  Family photography sessions last from 1-3 hours and my aim is to make it as enjoyable as possible so it feels more like play and less like a "formal photo shoot."
To experience a relaxed, fun, family portrait shoot at your home or on location, please Contact me to arrange a photography shoot for you.
