For over 20 years, my passion in Family photography.  I love capturing the amazing bond and connection between a parent and a child and telling that story through my eyes and lens. Family photography sessions last from 1-3 hours and my aim is to make it as enjoyable as possible so it feels more like play and less like a "formal photo shoot."
To experience a relaxed, fun, family portrait shoot at your home or on location, please Contact me to arrange a photography shoot for you.
